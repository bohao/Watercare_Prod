    <description>This lookup relationship is used to link a &quot;Work Step&quot; to a specific Service Appointment during the work step has been completed/answered. This is particularly important to link a &quot;Schedule Item Code&quot; work step to a Service Appointment, in order to identify what type of work a specific crew/subcontractor has done during their Service Appointment. Otherwise, the Work Steps are only linked to a Work Order or Work Order Line Item, making it impossible to tell on which Service Appointment the Work Step has been completed.</description>
