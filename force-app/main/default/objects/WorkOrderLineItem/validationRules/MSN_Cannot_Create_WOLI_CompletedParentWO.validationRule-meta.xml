    <active>true</active>
    <description>Validation rule to prevent users from creating a new WOLI, when its Parent WO is already in a &quot;completed&quot; state. This is required as Labour Lines created on Status &quot;Reviewed&quot; get split equally across WOLIs and cannot be amended after being sent to EAM.</description>

)
)</errorConditionFormula>
    <errorMessage>You are not allowed to create new WOLIs when the Parent is already Reviewed, Completed, or Canceled. Reason: Labour Lines get created on the Parent Status &quot;Reviewed&quot;, then get split across all WOLIs and cannot be amended retrospectively in Salesforce.</errorMessage>
