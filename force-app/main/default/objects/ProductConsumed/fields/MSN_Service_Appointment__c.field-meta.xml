    <description>This lookup relationship is used to link a &quot;Products Consumed&quot; record to a specific Service Appointment on which the product has been consumed. This is particularly important in order to identify what type of product (e.g. service product, labout etc.) a specific crew/subcontractor has consumed during their Service Appointment. Otherwise, the Products Consumed records are only linked to a Work Order or Work Order Line Item, making it impossible to tell on which Service Appointment exactly the product has been consumed.</description>
